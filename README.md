# Right-censored-survival-analysis

Research paper working together with Dr. Mecklin in 2012

Abstract: 
Two methods are generated to test whether Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) performed better than traditional methods (like Logrank test, Cox regression, and Weibull regression) in right censored survival analysis. Based on the simulation results, method I MVSS, found that GAMLSS 2 is more suitable to deal with non- normal and heteroscedastic right censored survival data. Since GAMLSS has higher power over other traditional methods in detecting the difference of unequal variances between two groups, and has similar power in detecting the difference of unequal means between two groups. Although there are many distribution families fit GAMLSS model, we find that Weibull model to weibull data distribution is the best one matching the GAMLSS model without incurring a high type I error here. In method II hazard ratio, GAMLSS 2 has superiority over other methods in large sample size with the lowest type I errors but similar power comparing with other traditional methods.
